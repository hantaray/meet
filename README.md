# Description
A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

### Serverless functions:
Meet will use serverless functions to improve data processing and scalability. It will make the app cost-effective and scalable. I saves time and money to implement and manage a own server infrastructore. Use cases for serverless functions are the processing for the data of the events, that a user selects and wants to be filtered or the generation of charts for the app.
